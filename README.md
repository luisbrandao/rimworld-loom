Simple Mod thats add a loom capable of recycling apparels. This mod does nothing but that.


Notes:
As far as I am aware of, there is no trivial way for me to define the output of the "recycling process", so I think a 100% apparel will give you 100% of the materials back. I know, a lossless operation isn't ideal, but there is not much I can do about this, and it is the main reason why I am making this a standalone mod.
